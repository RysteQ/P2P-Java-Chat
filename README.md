# P2P-Java-Chat

<br>

This repository is meant for me and two more people (only one of them helped so far) to collaborate on a team project for a subject at our university. You can find everyone that helped in this project under the **[Collabarators](#collaborators)** section of the document. I should mention that the program is not ready yet, I am still working on it from time to time and I am sorry that it isn't ready yet.

*Note: This is the current state of the code
