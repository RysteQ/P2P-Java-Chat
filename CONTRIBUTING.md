# Contributing

If you want to contribute then:
1) If you are a member of the team feel free to contribute whenever you want.
2) If you are not a member of the team then all the contributions will be accepted after July, after the deadline of the project.

Before you want to contribute please:
1) Make sure your code is as clean as possible by your standards.
2) Run the program beforehand except if you make very tiny changes.

*Any contribution of any kind is accepted although we would prefer if the contribution is intended to cleanup the code
